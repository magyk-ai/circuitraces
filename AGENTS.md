# Agent Instructions

**For AI assistants working on this project:**

This file serves as a pointer to the main development documentation. All development workflows, testing procedures, and operational guidelines are documented in:

👉 **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Complete development playbook

## Quick Reference

Before running any commands, ensure you're using the correct Node.js version:

```bash
nvm use 24
```

Then refer to CLAUDE.md for:
- Development workflow
- Testing procedures
- Build commands
- CI/CD operations
- Deployment instructions

## Why This File Exists

Some AI assistants look for `AGENTS.md` as a convention for agent-specific instructions. This file exists to redirect to the canonical documentation in `CLAUDE.md`.
